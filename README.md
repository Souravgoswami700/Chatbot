# Chatbot
This project proposes a Python-based chatbot that can simulate intelligent human-like conversations. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand user queries and provide meaningful responses. The chatbot can be trained using a custom corpus and is designed to be easily extendable for various domains like education, healthcare, and support.
